# Folder Adjustment Plan

## Plan:
1. **Consolidate Notebooks**:
   - Move the multiple versions of `Task_1.ipynb` and `Task_2.ipynb` into a single version for each task. This will reduce clutter in the `notebooks` folder.

2. **Organize Scripts**:
   - If there are more scripts planned, create subfolders within the `scripts` directory for different functionalities (e.g., `data_processing`, `visualization`). This will help in keeping the scripts organized.

3. **Frontend and Backend Structure**:
   - Ensure that the structure within the `brent-oil-dashboard/frontend` and `brent-oil-dashboard/backend` folders is consistent. This includes organizing components, assets, and utilities logically.

4. **General Cleanup**:
   - Review and remove any redundant files, and ensure that README files are up to date and informative.

## Follow-up Steps:
- After making these changes, verify the new structure to ensure it meets your expectations.
- Confirm with you for any additional requirements or modifications.
